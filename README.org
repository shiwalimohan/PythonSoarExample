An example to test Soar-on-server scenarios. 

* Soar
- Download the latest stable release from http://soar.eecs.umich.edu/Downloads
- Point =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= or =DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= to SoarSuite/bin

* Multiple agents example
- multi_agent_example.py contains two ways to run /n/ Soar agents
  1. =single= mode: /n/ agents on a single kernel where the agents' decision cycles are synchronized
  2. =multi= mode: /n/ agents run on n kernels where the agents' decision cycles are independent

- run: =python multi_agent_example.py -n <number of agents to be run> -m <single, multi>=
  - requires that =LD_LIBRARY_PATH= or =DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= points to SoarSuite/bin

- inputs:
  - currently does not accept inputs to agents

- outputs:
  - prints all processing status messages from the agents 
  - prints average time taken to make decisions
